  Integrated Janus WebRTC into a Human Resource Management System for real-time, modern communication.

- **Sappunchin – Secure Session Bridge for SAP & Microsoft Dynamics 365**  
  Built a robust session orchestration platform to integrate secure login flows between **MSDyn365 CRM** and **SAP systems**. Sappunchin uses **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Puppeteer Cluster** to automate sign-    ins, extract and manage cookies, and inject session identity across enterprise touchpoints. Supports SSL, dynamic form rendering (EJS), structured performance logging, and session fallback logic. Adaptable for    any platform needing automated login and secure session replication.

  > 🔐 Use Case: Seamless integration of SAP Fiori and MS Dynamics 365 portals using headless browser automation and custom session handoff.

- **Node.js Reverse Proxy Server (NGINX Replacement)
Engineered a high-performance, programmable reverse proxy solution using Node.js and http-proxy, serving as a flexible alternative to NGINX. Implemented dynamic domain and path-based routing, SSL termination, and a custom hybrid disk-memory caching system (hybridCustomCache) that reduced redundant upstream requests by up to 60%. Integrated Pino logging for granular request tracking and performance analytics, enabling real-time observability and debugging.

⚙️ Key Highlights:
• Achieved up to 40% faster average response times for cached routes
• Supported on-the-fly route configuration for multi-domain environments
• Enhanced transparency and maintainability with structured logging and cache metrics


- **Comprehensive DevOps Pipelines & Automated Deployments:**  
  Automated cloud infrastructure and application deployments using AWS services and **GitHub Actions**—including building CI/CD pipelines that deploy code directly to servers for seamless, reliable delivery.
